### Date created
I created this project and README file on January 08, 2021

### Project Title
Bike Share Project for my Udacity Course

### Description
In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
.gitignore
bikeshare.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv  
washington.csv  

### Credits
I have used https://git-scm.com/docs as a reference guide during the implementation of the third project of my Udacity Course
I have also benefited a lot from Udacity Course Material.
